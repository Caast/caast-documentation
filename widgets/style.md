# Customize style

Currently Caast Widget is only customizable via injected styles in our different components. Those styles can be injected in our administration interface. Nevertheless, we are working on offering you the ability to add a style parameter on each Caast Widget instance in order to have a really frictionless experience.

The injected styles will rely upon the Caast Library css classes naming available [here](library/style.md#iframe-styles)
